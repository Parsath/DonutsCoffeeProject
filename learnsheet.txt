    STEP 1 IN PROGRESS

    Notes:
        *I think I'll be working on the layout on my own without choosing the template.

        *Went through the css + Responsive Design course once again, I know what I have to do now.
        *Tomorow I'll be going through the Bootstrap Course, and will Start laying the grounding foundations of the website.
